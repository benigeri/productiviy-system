# Email Writing Guidelines

Style preferences for drafting email responses.

## Tone

- Professional but approachable
- Direct and concise
- Match the formality of the incoming email

## Structure

1. **Greeting**: Match what they used (Hi/Hey/Hello)
2. **Acknowledgment**: Brief reference to their message if appropriate
3. **Main content**: Get to the point quickly
4. **Action items**: Clear next steps if any
5. **Sign-off**: "Best," or "Thanks," followed by name

## Formatting

- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Bullet points for multiple items
- Bold for important dates/deadlines
- No emoji unless they used them first

## Response Length

- Quick answers: 2-3 sentences
- Detailed responses: Keep under 200 words
- Complex topics: Offer to schedule a call instead

## Common Patterns

### Scheduling
```
I'm available [times]. Let me know what works for you.
```

### Following up
```
Just wanted to check in on [topic]. Let me know if you need anything from me.
```

### Declining
```
Thanks for thinking of me. Unfortunately, I won't be able to [action] due to [brief reason]. [Optional alternative].
```

### Confirming
```
Sounds good - I'll [action] by [date].
```
